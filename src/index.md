<p> The <a href="http://grads.iges.org/grads">Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS)</a> is an interactive desktop
tool for easy access, manipulation, and visualization of earth science
data. The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opengrads/">
OpenGrADS Project</a> seeks to develop advanced interfaces and
extensions based on the main GrADS engine. </p>

<h1> Project Overview </h1>

The power of GrADS stems from its easy of use, speed and availability
on a wide number of platforms.  Traditionally, user extensions have
been possible by means of the GrADS scripting language, and user
defined functions.  The OpenGrADS Project aims at improving GrADS
extensibility by

<ul>

<li> developing a framework for high performance <i>user defined
commands</i> and <i>user defined functions</i>, allowing users to
add their own dynamically linked plugins;

<li> developing interfaces to modern scripting languages such as Perl and
Python, as as well as to scientific tools such as IDL, Octave and
Matlab, so that more powerful GrADS based applications can be
developed and integrated into other existing community efforts;

<li> establishing a central location for collaborative development of
packages for GrADS, coordinating the development of extensions in 
critical areas;

<li> providing a central repository of such extensions for the end-user.

</ul>

<p>

The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opengrads/">
OpenGrADS Project</a> intends to complement the GrADS development
going on at <a href="http://grads.iges.org/grads/">
COLA/IGES</a>, although from time to time patches to COLA
releases will be necessary to enable the latest OpenGrADS 
extensions.
